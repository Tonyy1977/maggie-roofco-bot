    "question": "What are the signs that I need a new roof?",
    "answer": "Common signs that your roof may need to be replaced include leaks, cracked, curled, or missing shingles, and excessive granule loss from asphalt shingles, which often appears in your gutters. Other interior signs, like cracked paint, discolored plasterboard, or peeling wallpaper, can also indicate a problem with your roof. While a single leak doesn't always mean a full replacement is needed, these signs are a good reason to get a professional inspection."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I choose the right roofing contractor?",
    "answer": "When selecting a roofing contractor, it's essential to vet and choose a qualified, reputable company. You should look for contractors who are licensed and insured, have a strong local reputation, and can provide references or examples of their past work. It's also a good idea to get two or three estimates and compare them. Remember that the lowest bid isn't always the best choice—quality of materials and craftsmanship are just as important as cost."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long will it take to install my new roof?",
    "answer": "The timeline for a new roof installation can vary. Factors like the size and complexity of your roof, the materials being used, and the weather can all affect the schedule. Generally, a new roof can be installed in one day to a couple of weeks."

  },
  {
    "question": "What type of roofing material is best for my home?",
    "answer": "The best roofing material for your home in the Hampton Roads, Virginia area depends on several factors, including climate, budget, aesthetics, and durability. Our region experiences a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters, and occasional severe weather like hurricanes. With this in mind, popular and effective options include: Asphalt Shingles: A cost-effective and popular choice that performs well in the local climate. Metal Roofing: An extremely durable and long-lasting option that comes in various styles. Tile Roofing: Provides an elegant look and can withstand harsh weather conditions. We recommend a consultation with one of our professionals to help you select the ideal option for your property."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much will a new roof cost?",
    "answer": "The cost of a new roof varies widely based on factors such as the size and layout of your roof, the materials you choose, and local labor rates. To get an accurate idea of the cost for your specific project, we recommend getting a free estimate. Our estimators can provide a detailed breakdown, helping you find the right balance of cost, quality, and long-term value. To help you determine the potential annual cost of your new roof, you can use this simple formula: Total Cost (materials and labor) / Life Expectancy of Roof (in years) = Annual Cost"
  },
  {
    "question": "How long will a new roof last?",
    "answer": "The lifespan of a roof depends on the material, proper installation, and maintenance. According to the American Society of Home Inspectors, here are the typical lifespans for some common materials: Asphalt Shingles: 15–20 years Wood Shingles/Shakes: 10–40 years Concrete Tiles: 20  years Slate: 75–200 years Metal Roofing: 15–75 years Proper installation and routine maintenance are crucial for maximizing your roof's lifespan."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does a slate roof last?",
    "answer": "Slate is one of the most durable and long-lasting roofing materials available. A properly maintained slate roof can last anywhere from 75 to several hundred years, depending on the type of slate. For example, Virginia Buckingham slate is known to protect homes for 200 years or more."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does my slate roof need to be replaced, or can it be repaired?",
    "answer": "Just because you find broken or missing slate pieces doesn't necessarily mean you need an entire new roof. Individual pieces can often be replaced as needed to maintain the roof's integrity. Our trained inspectors can assess the general condition of your roof and recommend the necessary repairs. If your historic roof is nearing the end of its service life, we will provide a free estimate to help you determine the best course of action."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often should I have my slate roof inspected?",
    "answer": "We recommend a yearly inspection for all slate roofs, or after any major storms, to ensure there are no broken or missing pieces. Our professionals will inspect the entire roofing system—including the slate, flashings, and gutters—to catch any issues early and prevent costly interior leaks. As a token of our appreciation, we are proud to offer an exclusive Customer Appreciation Inspection Details with every residential project we complete. This complimentary inspection ensures your new roof is functioning perfectly and gives you peace of mind that your investment is sound."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is my chimney leaking?",
    "answer": "Chimney leaks can be difficult to diagnose because there are many potential causes. Common reasons include cracks in the chimney crown, damaged flashing, deteriorated mortar joints, or a faulty chimney cap. A leak may have one or more of these causes, and it may take more than one repair to completely fix it. If you suspect your chimney is leaking, our team can provide a thorough inspection to determine the source of the problem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the best commercial roofing materials?",
    "answer": "The best commercial roofing material depends on the building's specific needs, budget, and local climate. We often recommend two excellent single-ply membrane options: GAF TPO Roof Installation Videos : TPO is durable, energy-efficient, and highly resistant to UV radiation. Its seams are hot-air welded, making them three times stronger than conventional rubber roofs, which helps prevent leaks. TPO is also flexible and easy to install. FiberTite Commercial Roofing Videos : FiberTite is a high-performance, single-ply membrane known for its exceptional durability and longevity. It is engineered with a heavier base fabric than TPO or PVC, giving it superior resistance to punctures and tears. FiberTite's proprietary formula also provides excellent resistance to a broad range of chemicals, grease, and fats, making it a great choice for roofs exposed to harsh environmental factors. EPDM Roofing Systems Videos : EPDM (ethylene propylene diene terpolymer) is a durable synthetic rubber roofing membrane that has been a top choice for low-slope commercial roofs for decades. It is available in black or white and can be installed in a variety of ways, including fully adhered, mechanically attached, or ballasted.​ EPDM is known for its resistance to weathering, ozone, and abrasion, as well as its flexibility in low temperatures. We can help you choose the best material for your specific commercial building and provide a detailed assessment."
  },
  {
    "question": "When should I repair or replace my commercial roof?",
    "answer": "The decision to repair or replace your commercial roof depends on the extent of the damage. Minor leaks, punctures, or localized damage can often be repaired. However, if there are widespread issues, multiple leaks, or your roof is nearing the end of its expected lifespan, a full replacement may be the more cost-effective long-term solution. Our team can inspect your roof and provide a detailed assessment to help you make an informed decision. This video demonstrates a specific part of the installation process for a FiberTite mechanical roof system. FiberTite Mechanical Install"
